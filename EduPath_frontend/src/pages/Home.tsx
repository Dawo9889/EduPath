        <p>
          EduPath serves as a dedicated platform for sharing files, submitting assignments, and managing course activities. Each course is represented as a separate repository managed by the teacher, who can customize access, tasks, and deadlines. Students join these repositories upon invitation and approval, gaining the ability to upload their work and collaborate efficiently.
